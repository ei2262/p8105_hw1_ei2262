The dataset `penguins` focuses on the following descriptive
characteristics of penguins:

1.  Type of species (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)
2.  Island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Biscoe, Dream or
    Torgersen)
3.  Bill length of penguin (in mm)
4.  Bill depth of penguin (in mm)
5.  Flipper length of penguin (in mm)
6.  Body mass of penguin (in g)
7.  Sex of penguin (female or male)
8.  Study year (2007, 2008, or 2009)

The dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is
200.92 mm.

## Scatterplot

The following is a scatterplot with `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis and
`flipper_length_mm`on the y-axis. The dataset is color coordinated based
on the variable `species`.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

The scatterplot was exported as a pdf to my project directory using
`ggsave`. It was named “penguinsplot.”

# Problem 2

## Creating a dataframe called `hw1_df`

``` r
hw1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(n = 10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_character = c("d","s","h","o","m","e","w","o","r","k"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("high", "med","high","high","high","low","low","low","med","med"))
)

mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_numeric))
## [1] -0.1368761

mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))
## [1] 0.5

mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_character))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_character)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA

mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
```

After creating the dataframe, I tried calculating the mean of each
variable. I was able to calculate the mean for two variables:
*vec_numeric* and *vec_logical*. When I calculated the mean for
variables *vec_character* and *vec_factor*, I got an output of **NA**.

## Applying `as.numeric`

``` r
logical_num = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))
mean(logical_num)

character_num = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_character))
mean(character_num)

factor_num = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
mean(factor_num)
```

#### What happens?

After applying the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and
factor variables, I was able to calculate the mean of the logical and
factor variables. The character variable produces **NA** as the output.

#### Why?

A logical vector has two possible levels, true or false. In `hw1_df`, a
logical operator (“\>”) is used to identify the inputs (elements of the
random sample) and return a logical value. Therefore, when `as.numeric`
is applied, the observations in a logical vector is converted to a 0
(false) or to a 1 (true). 0 and 1 are both numeric values and can be
used to calculate a mean value. In the logical vector I created in
`hw_1df`,

A factor vector can have multiple levels. The one created in `hw1_df`
has 3 levels: high, medium, and low. When `as.numeric` was applied to
it, each level was converted to a corresponding number, such as 1 for
high, 2 for medium, and 3 for low. Numbers 1 - 3 were then used to
calculate a mean value.

A character vector is not numeric or logical because it is made up of
characters. In the character vector created in `hw1_df`, some of values
in the character strings are not properly formatted. Therefore,
`as.numeric` cannot convert the characters to numeric values. This
results in the **NA** output with the warning message: NAs introduced by
coercion.

##### Understanding the output of `mean()`

Analyzing the results of `mean()` after applying `as.numeric` helped me
understand what happens when I try to take the mean of the variables in
my dataframe.
